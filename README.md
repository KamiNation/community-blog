Do you love writing? Or does learning to write interest you? Submit a blog post to be featured on [Code Collabo's blog](https://code-collabo.hashnode.dev). The blog post(s) can be about anything in open source, it does not have to be related to or specific to the Code Collabo community.

## First steps: How to start contributing
- You can first confirm that you should go ahead to write a blog post that you have in mind, by creating a task on the [issues page](https://github.com/code-collabo/submit-a-blog-post/issues). Indicate the title and a short/one-line description. [@Ifycode](https://github.com/Ifycode) will review and get back to you.
- DO NOT copy and paste someone else's blog post from somewhere on the internet to present as your own work. Submit blog post written in your own words. If you do use someone else's words, design etc, please reference them in the blog post and include links to such works where necessary.

## Formatting and submitting your blog post

````
**Title: Your blog post title goes here**

Subtitle: Blog post subtitle goes here (subtitle is optional)

*Blog post by [Your full name here](link to your github profile here).*

The body/content of your blog post goes here
````

- There is no develop branch for this project at the moment. Create a new branch from the main branch.
- In the new branch, create a markdown file i.e. file with .md extension. The (full) title of the blog post you are submitting should be the name of the .md file you create (make sure to use hyphens in the file name instead of spaces). 
- Use the format in the box above to add your blog content to the .md file. Here's an example of how your blog post submission should look like in a .md file after using the format in the box above - add .md file example here.
- Submit a pull request and wait for review. Here's an example of what it will look like after it is accepted and published on hashnode - [hashnode blog post example](https://code-collabo.hashnode.dev/what-is-code-collabo-and-who-is-it-for).
