Hi, and welcome to Code Collabo's blog. Code Collabo came into existence sometime last year (in February 2021). I'm really excited about starting this blog. In this first blog post, I hope to help you understand what Code Collabo is, and who it is for.

Code Collabo is a free and open source community project, with the aim of helping anyone get started with contributing to open source. But then, anyone is welcome to contribute whether they are new to open source or not. My next post will be dedicated to explaining what "free and open source" is in great detail, but for now, you can [read a little bit about the terminology from Outreachy's website](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#what-is-free-software). 

A subsequent blog post will also feature me writing in detail about what contributions are, what counts as contributions (in Code Collabo), and how to start contributing to the Code Collabo project. For now, you can [read about contributions from Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-graphs-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile). I also will be writing about contributing to the community at large, and to individual projects. So much to write about, and I can't wait to share them all with you soon.

Using this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has made contributions to any of Code Collabo's projects/libraries in the past year. You are also welcome to contribute if you have never contributed before. There will be upgrades to existing projects, and there may be addition of new one(s). Looking forward to seeing you around, and what we build together.
